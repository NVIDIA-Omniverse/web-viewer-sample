# Omniverse Web Viewer Sample Application

<p align="center">
  <img src="readme-assets/sample.png" width=100% />
</p>

This sample is part of the larger [Omniverse Embedded Web Viewer Example](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/web-viewer.html).
The sample demonstrates how a front end client can present a streamed 
Omniverse Kit application and how to send messages back and forth between 
the two apps.

This application is designed to be used with the `USD Viewer Sample` in https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-app-template.
The messages sent and handled by this sample expects the USD Viewer Sample. However, with some editing it can also be 
used to stream any other Kit application as well. 

This is a React application that has been build using the Vite 
framework (https://github.com/vitejs).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installation (https://nodejs.org/en/download).
- Chromium browser.
- Use of `USD Viewer Template` based application created in [kit-app-template](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-app-template) using Kit 106.1.0 or more recent. Section [Client Options](#client-options) describes how to use other applications.

## Quick Start

This section describes how to run the solution in dev mode on a local workstation.

1. Make sure the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are fulfilled. Refer to the [package.json's engine section](package.json#L10-11) for the minimum Node.js and npm versions required to run this application. To verify your Node.js and npm installations, run these commands and it should print the version numbers:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

2. Launch a streaming Kit application based on the [USD Viewer Template](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-app-template/tree/main/templates/apps/usd_viewer).

3. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/web-viewer-sample.git
```

4. Navigate into the project:

```bash
cd web-viewer-sample
```

5. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

> **_NOTE:_**  A new terminal is needed for `npm` commands if Node.js was recently installed.

If you encounter the following `Unsupported engine` warning, it indicates that you do not have the correct Node.js or npm version installed for this application and your app may not work as expected. Refer to the [package.json's engine section](package.json#L10-11) for the minimum required versions.

```bash
npm warn EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {
npm warn EBADENGINE   package: '@nvidia/web-viewer-sample@1.4.0',
npm warn EBADENGINE   required: { node: '^18.0.0', npm: '^10.0.0' },
npm warn EBADENGINE   current: { node: '17.0.0', npm: '10.9.2' }
npm warn EBADENGINE }
```

6. Run the client:

```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Open a Chromium browser and navigate to [localhost:5173](localhost:5173).
 
At this point you should see options for configuring the client.

> **_NOTE:_**  When running this application in a container, you can serve the optimized production files generated by `npm run build`, rather than starting the development server. After running `npm run build`, the static files will be located in the `dist` directory.

### Client Options

When running this client, you will be presented with options to configure options prior to the stream launching. These
options will vary depending on the stream source defined in the [stream.config.json](stream.config.json) file.  

All stream sources will initally display an `Include USD Viewer UI?` prompt. Selecting `USD Viewer UI` will include a UI
for sending messages to a running Kit application. This is necessary for the USD Viewer template, which in the default use
case requires a client to send a request to open a file. Select `Streamed app only` for other use cases such as when
streaming USD Viewer loading a file on startup or for completely different Kit applications.

<p align="center">
  <img src="readme-assets/include-web-ui.png"/>
</p>

As an exercise, create an application from a different template (such as `USD Composer`) in the [kit-app-template repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-app-template).
Run the streaming version of that application and this client.

Note that without any `custom messages` being sent you can interact with the application within the client interface as if you were using the actual application.

<p align="center">
  <img src="readme-assets/viewport-only.png" width=100% />
</p>

When running the client using `stream` as the source in the [stream.config.json](stream.config.json) file, you will be presented with addtitional options for
entering an application and stream server, selecting an application, application version and application profile prior to creating the streaming session.

> **_NOTE:_**  The stream instance is automatically terminated if the max reconnect attempts [defined in the stream config](./src/AppStream.tsx#L118) are exceeded. If more time is needed,
you should increase this value. This may be necessary on the first attempt, as Kit needs additional time for shader caching.

### Interacting with the solution

The streamed RTX viewport within this client is interactable:

- Left mouse button click on the viewport to activate its interactivity by giving it focus.
- Left mouse button click to select something in the viewport.
- ALT + left mouse button drag to orbit with the camera.
- ALT + right mouse button drag to zoom.
- Middle mouse button drag to pan the camera.
- Hold right mouse button down for fly mode:
  - W: forward
  - A: left
  - S: reverse
  - D: right
  - Q: down
  - E: up
  - Use mouse scroll wheel to increase and decrease the camera speed

The `USD Asset` selector tells the streamed application which OpenUSD asset to load.

The `USD Stage` presents the contents of the OpenUSD asset.

- Select an item here and it also selects in the viewport.
- Select something in the viewport and this list shows what was selected.


## Front End Client Development

If this sample ticks all the boxes for what you want to develop then you are off to a good 
start. Simply make it your own and continue developing in it. However, it’s likely that you 
have an existing client that you want to embed the viewer into. 
In the section [Embed Viewer in an Existing Client](README.md#embed-viewer-in-an-existing-client) 
we provide instructions for how to add the `omniverse-webrtc-streaming-library` as a dependency. 
The library will provide pixel streaming and messaging to your client. The remainder of the topics 
here are presented in context of this sample so that it’s easy to follow along and try things out. 
Use this sample as a reference for implementing in your own client.

### Embed Viewer in an Existing Client

To embed the viewer in your existing client you’ll need to add the 
`omniverse-webrtc-streaming-library` as a dependency to your project:

 - Refer to [.npmrc](.npmrc).
 - Refer to [package.json](package.json) `dependencies` section.

### AppStreamer

The most important part of this sample is the [./src/AppStream.tsx](src/AppStream.tsx) file and its 
use of the `AppStreamer` class imported from the `omniverse-webrtc-streaming-library`. 
The `AppStreamer` is used for any implementation and `AppStream.tsx` is a reference implementation 
for initializing the stream and providing bi-directional messaging between the front end client 
and the Kit application.

#### Keyboard Event Management

The video HTML element presenting the streamed application reacts to keyboard and mouse
events in order to support camera movement, selection, and other 3D viewport interactions.
The `tabIndex` of the `<div>` wrapping the video element needs to have the tabIndex set to 
`tabIndex={0}` as seen in [./src/AppStream.tsx](src/AppStream.tsx). One - yes one - other interactive elements 
in the client also needs this tabIndex setting such as the selectable items in 
[./src/USDStage.tsx](src/USDStage.tsx). These tabIndex setting allows each element to receive
the right focus and interactivity. Without it you may find that only the viewport reacts to 
keyboard events.

### Initialize the Stream

The `AppStreamer`’s `connect()` function initializes the streaming and messaging. Here you provide a 
`streamConfig` object with configuration settings and a set of functions to handle messages.

This sample provides configuration via the [stream.config.json](stream.config.json) file. There are three different
source values that are supported: `local`, `gfn` and `stream`. The default `source` is set to `local` which is the setting to use unless you are embedding a 
stream from [GDN](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/solutions/stream-3d-apps/).
For GDN you need to contact your NVIDIA representative and get the appropriate configuration details.

For `local` configuration in [stream.config.json](stream.config.json) you change the `server` 
to the ip address where the Kit application is streamed from. With the ip address set you can see how 
[AppStream.tsx](src/AppStream.tsx) constructs a `streamConfig` object providing a stream resolution and framerate (view code example [here](./src/AppStream.tsx#L89-103)).

For `stream` configuration in [stream.config.json](stream.config.json), you can enter default `streamServer` and `appServer` values, but these
values are also configurable prior to creating the streaming session via the front-end when the application is launched.

It’s important to note that the "stream resolution” is the size of the Kit application. It is not the resolution 
in the Kit application viewport. By default, the USD Viewer template is set to change the viewport resolution to 
fit the size of the viewport; meaning, the resolution is adjusted as the application window is resized. 
If you want to add the ability to change the viewport resolution during an active session you could send a custom 
message from the front end client to request the change.

> **_NOTE:_**  The `gfn-client-sdk.js` script source in [index.html](index.html) can be removed when using `local` or `stream` sources. That library reference is only needed when streaming from GDN/GFN.

### Custom Messages with AppStreamer

There are two critical things to recognize when working with AppStreamer and custom messages:
- `AppStreamer.sendMessage()` lets you send a custom message.
- The stream config data that's passed to the `AppStreamer` (`RagnarokConfig` or `GFNConfig`) lets you register a handler for incoming messages via `onCustomEvent` (view code example [here](./src/AppStream.tsx#L101)).


#### Message Format

All custom messages exchanged between the front end client and the streamed Omniverse Kit application follows the same format:
an object with properties `event_type` and `payload` that is JSON stringified prior to being sent off.

```typescript
{
    event_type: "myEvent",
    payload: {
        property_name  : value
    }
}
```

On the receiving end, the Omniverse Kit application will need an Extension that handles `myEvent` and it's `payload`. The Kit
application sends similar messages for this client to handle. Below we explore how messages are used in this solution for
opening a USD stage,

#### Send a Custom Message

Messages sent by `AppStreamer` are strings. To make a message usable by your custom Kit Extension based on 
`omni.kit.livestream.messaging` usage you’ll need to comply with the message format stated above.
A practical and easy to read approach to do this is to first create an object:

```typescript
const message = {
  event_type: 'changeResolutionRequest',
    payload: {
      width: 2048,
      height: 1152
  }
}
```

Then use json to stringify the message object and ask AppStreamer to send it:

```typescript
AppStreamer.sendMessage(JSON.stringify(message));
```

This sample's [Window.tsx](src/Window.tsx) shows many examples of sending messages.

#### Receive a Custom Message

The function registered for custom events with `AppStreamer.connect()` should expect the same message object 
structure used to send messages.

```typescript
private _myCustomMessageHander (event: any): void {
    if (!event) {
        return;
    }
    if (event.event_type === 'changeResolutionConfirmation') {
        console.log('Resolution was changed in Kit app: ' + event.payload.resolution);
    }
}
```

This sample's [Window.tsx](src/Window.tsx) has a `_handleCustomEvent` that shows many examples of handling messages.

### Sample Message Loop

The below function from [Windows.tsx](src/Window.tsx) provides an example of sending a message to the streamed 
Omniverse Kit application. The client sends a `openStageRequest` with a `url` property in the `payload`.

```typescript
_openSelectedAsset = () => {
        ...
        const message: AppStreamMessageType = {
            event_type: "openStageRequest",
            payload: {
                url: this.state.selectedUSDAsset.url
            }
        };
        AppStream.sendMessage(JSON.stringify(message));
    }
```

The Kit application has a handler for `openStageRequest` that opens the USD asset with the provided `url`. Once that
asset has loaded the Kit application sends a `openedStageResult` which is handled by the client as shown below.

The `openedStageResult` handler to the request to open the asset can found in `src/Windows.tsx` as well:

```typescript
_handleCustomEvent = (event: any) => {
    ...
    // response received once a USD asset is fully loaded
    else if (event.event_type === "openedStageResult") {
        if (event.payload.result === "success") {
            this._queryLoadingState() 
            console.log('Kit App communicates an asset was loaded: ' + event.payload.url);
            this._getChildren(null); // Hide progress indicator
        } else {
            console.error('Kit App communicates there was an error loading: ' + event.payload.url);
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

The `event_type` is used by both applications to triage how to handle a message. The `payload` is the data of the message.
This `payload` can contain whatever data is desired.

The above is a **custom capability of this example solution**. Developers should decide on what messages and payloads to
implement for their solutions.

## Updating Dependencies

The `omniverse-webrtc-streaming-library` is updated over time. To get the most recent version:

1. Delete the `./node_modules` directory if it exists.
2. Delete the [package-lock.json](./package-lock.json) file.
3. Pull dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Troubleshooting

Things don't always turn out as expected. If you are not getting the expected results use the below steps to troubleshoot.

### General steps

- Check the browser console for errors.
- Check the Kit application log for errors.
- Test with an unmodified version of the project to see if any changes may have created some problem.
- If you are streaming the Omniverse Kit application from another device, does the problem go 
away if you stream it on the same device that this front end client is running on? If so you may have a
network issue.
- Check if your browser was updated to a more recent version. Sometimes browsers are set to be auto 
updated. Does it work if you use an older version?
- Check the web browser log for errors.
- Check the Omniverse Kit application. Did something go wrong at the other end?
- Restart the solution:
  - Shut down the dev server. 
  - Shut down the Kit application. 
  - Start the Kit application. 
  - Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
- If you are running `npm install` using Windows PowerShell and are encountering a `File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.` error:
  - Restart PowerShell as administrator
  - Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
  - Follow the prompt to change the execution policy
  - Re-run `npm install`

### Refreshing the Client

Kit app streaming is designed to start, run, and end; however, while developing the solution you may want to refresh the client 
in a browser and thus interrupt the normal flow.

Restarting the client could cause errors on the Kit application side. If the stream does not immediately re-appear just wait a few seconds.
If it still does not appear try refreshing the browser one more time. If this doesn't work you may need to restart the Kit application and client.
